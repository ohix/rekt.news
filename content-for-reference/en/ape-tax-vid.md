_Now don’t try to kid me man cub, I made a deal with you._

Four billion years have passed since we first emerged from the primordial soup, and now a new evolution has begun.

**Ape Season is here, and Ape Tax must be paid.**

_This digital darwinism takes place over blocks rather than millennia._

Just as relevant as when it was [first published in December of 2020](https://rekt.news/ape-tax/), our second major video release is an animated assessment of our online gambling culture.

Subtitles are available in various languages, and more will be added soon.
