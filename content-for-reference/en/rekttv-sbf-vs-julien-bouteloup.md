It’s been four weeks since the inception of [Rekt](/), and things are moving fast.

+2600 followers, 12 pieces of investigative journalism, and a growing community of contributors behind the scenes.

Following our [Whale Hunt](/whale-hunt-sbf-blue-kirby/) article investigating crowd mentality and on-chain activity, Blue Kirby deleted his account, and SBF came in for an interview to try and clear his name.

We will always aim to cover both sides of the story, so it seemed only fair to let SBF present his opinions.

SBF is a relatively new character in the crypto ecosystem. During the DeFi summer he became notorious for his ruthless trading activity and involvement with the controversial SushiSwap.

Blue Kirby also rose to fame during the DeFi summer as he rode the coattails of the YFI boom.

The once prolific YFI hype man is now in disgrace after losing his role at Yearn, and then being shamed by the community for attempting to launch a low quality ICO.

When SBF retweeted a promotion for this ICO, the unexpected interaction raised eyebrows, and fueled our investigation.

For the debut episode of rektTV, Julien Bouteloup and SBF go head to head for over an hour on a range of topics including Blue Kirby, Cream Finance, SBF on-chain activity, SushiSwap, and more.

[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=78s) SBF - I started out my career at Jane Street Capital

[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=159s)**JB - How do you differentiate your activity between Alameda & FTX?**

[06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=394s)**JB **- **Can you explain your point of view - why wasn’t this [(rekt post)](/whale-hunt-sbf-blue-kirby/) accurate information in your opinion?**

[07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=435s) SBF - I think that there’s a pretty decent case for changing the collateral factor of FTT

[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=456s) SBF - I think a lot of the takes on it (FTT as collateral) have been pretty one-sided and not super well thought out

[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=579s)**JB **- ** I would like a quote from you summarising your thoughts on SushiSwap?**

[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=653s) SBF - I was pretty surprised when that (SushiSwap) happened.

[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=710s) SBF - I think it (Sushi Transfer) was like 11 million

[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=771s)**JB **- ** So you got the keys of SushiSwap without even knowing about it?**

[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=798s) SBF - I was not involved in the development of SushiSwap at all

[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=827s)**JB -  For some people it might look like you are the Sushi master…**

[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=850s) SBF - It was a crazy day - it was completely bananas

[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=862s) SBF - I was asleep - someone shouted out saying that Nomi was going to give us the keys

[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=890s)**JB -  Did you ever receive a message from Hayden (Adams)?**

[15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=929s) SBF - He was definitely not happy with SushiSwap and happy to see it get rugged

[15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=945s) SBF - If SushiSwap never happened then the UNI token would not be live

[16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1015s)**JB -  So you’re basically saying that people are stupid to buy the UNI token?**

[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1046s)**JB -  Are you guys still building (SushiSwap) or are you leaving it as an AMM?**

[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1117s)**JB -  What happened on C.R.E.A.M? Walk me through the chronology, people were really pissed off…**

[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1200s)**JB -  You took $80m worth of FTT and put them on C.R.E.A.M…**

[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1253s)**JB -  FTT token is controlled by FTX - it’s a centralised token and you’re using the decentralised economy…**

[21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1302s) SBF - The point about shorting…

[24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1469s) SBF - Being public was definitely not the intention!

[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1649s)**JB -  How do you ensure sensitive FTX customer information doesn’t end up with the Alameda team?**

[30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1808s)**JB -  So if you had to do it (C.R.E.A.M) again, you would do the exact same thing?**

[30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1851s)**JB -  The CEO (of C.R.E.A.M) was very happy for you to put $80m of FTT into the platform...**

[32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=1941s)**JB** -  Whenever there’s a multi-sig you want to be added into it!

[35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2108s)**JB -  You also added yourself into the Yearn shit show with Blue Kirby**

[36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2174s)**JB **-  **What happened on the Blue Kirby ICO - did he ask you to retweet it?**

[40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2427s) SBF - Executives in crypto can’t communicate with the community

[41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2512s)**JB -  What do you think about what happened to Blue Kirby?**

[42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2555s)**JB -  Were you in crypto in 2017?**

[43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2586s)**JB -  Why did you get yourself involved in that shit (Blue Kirby ICO)?**

[45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=2748s) SBF - Blue Kirby ICO was a ham-fisted launch but not an attempt to rugpull

[50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3050s)**JB -  What about building yourself a multisig and forking Blue Kirby’s ICO?**

[51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3083s)**JB -  What is Serum and what’s the vision with the project?**

[52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3146s) SBF - What do I think of Ethereum?

[56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3383s)**JB -  What is the vision of FTX?**

[58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3499s) SBF - What’s the end game here?

[1:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3620s)**JB -  Could Solana become the high frequency trading aspect of ETH 2.0?**

[1:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3664s)**JB\*\***-  Plug & play or Drag & Fork any smart contract in Solidity or Vyper into Solana
\*\*

[1:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3682s) SBF - Sometimes the best layer 2 is something that can also be a layer 1

[1:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3704s) SBF - Loopring is more relaxed, Serum and Solana is more like a giant financial ecosystem all on the same chain

[1:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3880s)**JB -  I used to be a Bitcoin maximalist**

[1:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=3934s) SBF - There are other networks I’m excited about as well

[1:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4041s)**JB -  Would you consider yourself a hero or a villain in the crypto community?**

[1:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4079s)**JB -  Are you still into effective altruism?**

[1:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4087s) SBF - All this money’s going to get donated in the end

[1:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4156s)**JB -  So the best move is, and don’t say this is alpha leak because…**

[1:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4344s) SBF - Before yield farming, the total historical volume of DeFi was less than a single busy day on FTX

[1:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4428s) SBF - TVL is super inflated right now, it’s all wash trading

[1:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4637s) SBF - The vision for Serum long term is…

[1:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4689s) SBF - Having a centralised exchange run a decentralised exchange is an interesting concept.

[1:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4749s)**JB -  But you have CZ (Binance) on the board on FTX?**

[1:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4870s)**JB - Do you work with Bitmex?**

[1:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxSOWxRMC8&t=4967s) SBF - The philosophy of Serum is..
