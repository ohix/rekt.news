**We hit a new low. A blue-chip rekt by a front-end attack.**

A developer who had been contracted to work on the MISO auction for _“JayPegs Automart”_ inserted his own wallet address into the contract instead of the **auctionWallet**.

**Remind us, which part of crypto is supposed to be “trustless”?**

_Misplaced faith cost MISO $3.1 million._

_The aftermath was more aggressive than usual._

In a since deleted tweet, Sushi CTO [Joseph DeLong went public](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1438712356352274433?s=20) with his suspicions, doxxing the developer he believed to be responsible.

>The Miso front end has become the victim of a supply chain attack. An anonymous contractor by with the GH handle AristoK3 injected malicious code into the Miso front end. We have reason to believe this is [@eratos1122](https://twitter.com/eratos1122).

[Eratos1122 protested](https://twitter.com/eratos1122/status/1438868691857420293?s=20), but the Sushi team had made their case, and they refused to back down.

DeLong had attached the resume, personal website, Facebook profile, email address and invoice details of eratos1122 into a [public Google doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2M_-rWcnGcX65nL24UydzC7DrUfT_g0AZxNlQVUJ-c/edit)

After a few hours of these details being made public, and following threats from the Sushi team to involve the FBI, the money was returned. (865.094 of 864.8 ether, more than was originally stolen) 

_The doxx document is now private, however some of the contents are detailed below._

**We’ll let the rekt readers decide why the funds were returned.**

**When whitehat developers switch hats to black, they often forget to cover their tracks.** 

Doxxing somebody like that is a serious step to take, and the Sushi team / Joseph DeLong must have had a lot of conviction in order to be so public with their accusation.

The tweets and documents may no longer be available, but the Sushi and Jaypeg team still seem confident that their suspicions were correct.

**Until now, Eratos1122 had earned a decent reputation in the space**, and [his Github](https://github.com/eratos1122) shows a lot of experience. Whether the accusations against him are truthful or not, this incident will not be forgotten.

**Another close call for Sushiswap, who have appeared in [rekt.news](https://www.rekt.news/) in the past, but always seem to escape total disaster.**

_However, regardless of refund, a hack is a hack, and this one’s going on [the leaderboard.](https://www.rekt.news/leaderboard/)_

With [0xMaki stepping down](https://twitter.com/0xMaki/status/1439037342740729857?s=20) as the leader of SushiSwap, some are taking the opportunity to [post bearish tweets](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1438902466570072070?s=19) about the Uniswap competitor. However, you have to consider [their motives.](https://www.paradigm.xyz/team/danrobinson/posts/) 

**Meanwhile, at Jaypegs Automart, forced memes are 20% off!!!**
