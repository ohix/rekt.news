**Rekt around the clock.** 

Attacks can happen at any time, but the weekends are always busiest.

Social tokens haven’t taken off yet, but that doesn’t mean Roll didn’t get rekt. 

[$5.7 million gone](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfa36e3169bea7f56065a65ab1ccf47d340a68b374278fadfc43e926d4163f94f), ripped from the liquidity pools of multiple DeFi influencers and “celebrities”.

DeFi is a danse macabre, where your status is irrelevant. The rekt reaper pays no heed to fame or influence, if there’s a hole in the code or in your own OPSEC then just it’s a matter of time until the music stops.

**Over 7 hours since the attack and still no public statement from [@tryrollhq](https://twitter.com/tryrollhq).**

Saying ["It's 4AM, we'll announce tomorrow"](https://twitter.com/MyCrypto/status/1371023004272975876?s=19) is bad enough, but not following up on that is even worse. 

[Igor](https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1371039886657085445?s=19) Igamberdiev states that this attack was a possible private key compromise or inside job, and that 

>“Currently, the attacker has sold all the stolen tokens, but it remains unclear whether they have access to other elements of Roll’s infrastructure.”

The tokens were taken from a Roll hot wallet, which not only received social tokens from Roll’ multisig but was also sponsored by Roll multisig owners.

As [@ameensol](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1371109368985382915?s=19) pointed out on Twitter; this attack could have been avoided if Roll had not “insisted on a fixed supply token setup where they sit on a time bomb of 10% of the supply of each social token minted on their platform”

The fixed token supply model introduces a lot of trust assumptions;

- someone has to LP
- vesting for both the creator and TryRoll
- incentive alignment fades as creator sells 

**We reached out to the Roll team but had no response.**

Apparently, the [hacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5fe4e7124d1da9046edc67a6499b565241be0167) was not bullish long-term on any of the celebrities, as they chose to immediately dump each token for ETH and escape through Tornado Swap to enter a reasonable position of number 14 on our [leaderboard](https://rekt.eth.link/leaderboard/).

**This disrespectful dump caused each token to drop in price.**

**This was an unusual attack due to it’s personal nature.**

A direct insult to each token owner, and an interesting insight into the negative aspects of tokenising yourself. This hack gives a taste of what social token owners will experience in the future. 

**How long until KSI has an RSI? When can we put Bollinger Bands on PewDiePie?**

_In a not so distant future..._

>A top Youtuber releases a particularly good “Elders react to unboxing challenge” video, goes viral, and everybody gets rich as their stochastic crossover goes through the 20 band due to everyone “smashing that subscribe button”. 

>The next day somebody uncovers a tweet from 2014 - the Youtuber has been caught using discriminatory language against Tumblr users, a death cross forms between the 200 and the 50 MA and their token dumps into oblivion. 

>The Youtuber is cancelled and everybody gets liquidated.

**No space is safe, even social tokens have their dark side.** 

Poor management decisions built up a tempting treasury , and somebody decided to take it. 

If it was an inside job or an audit oversight is yet to be known, as we _still_ await any announcement from Roll.

**This attack might slow down Social Tokens, but it won’t stop them.**

>If you thought NFTs were controversial, then you’re not ready for what’s coming next.
