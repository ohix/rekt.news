**Goodbye Dego Finance.**

~$10M taken across [three chains](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1491729892920393729?s=20&t=y9_nC1Vvyfi87n84jrOeQA) from Dego and their [strategic partner](https://cocosbcx.medium.com/cocos-bcx-builds-a-strategic-alliance-with-dego-finance-in-metaverse-gamefi-and-more-23cc838fbde0) Cocos-BCX.

Dego have claimed this to be a case of compromised keys, leaving us wondering:

_Why didn’t they use a multi-sig?_

The _“[lego of the decentralised world](https://dego.finance/home)”_ protocol has asked Binance to pause deposits of their native token.

**They’ve also [asked Uniswap](https://twitter.com/dego_finance/status/1491633450792538116?s=20&t=M4LhH6CTUmnAIWfCZ87NeQ) to prevent users from trading $DEGO, suggesting the founders might not understand the DeFi legos that feature in their branding.**

_Incompetence, or bad intentions?_

**Another case of “compromised keys” leaves us with little to say.**

_Obviously the attacker took it all._

[Slowmist](https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1491692468055592960?s=20&t=rjGvgk59_VcejquaKRRcEg) shows a list of the stolen assets.

**Attackers address on ETH:** [0x118203b0f2a3ef9e749d871c8fef5e5e55ef5c91](https://etherscan.io/address/0x118203b0f2a3ef9e749d871c8fef5e5e55ef5c91) 

_And [Binance Smart Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0x118203b0f2a3ef9e749d871c8fef5e5e55ef5c91), and [Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/explorer/address/0x118203B0f2A3ef9e749D871C8fEF5e5e55ef5C91/token-transfers)_

The attacker helped themselves to multiple LP tokens on both BSC and ETH, and then [minted 600k DEGO](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9b65bb0e9899a56dff9a14aa6ac33dfb64d2e5b9906199367a7c1191720d0834), causing the price of DEGO to fall by 16%.

Despite their poor security decisions, the DEGO price chart shows a steady recovery, perhaps due to their large following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dego_finance) (~194K) and other medias.

Since the attack, Cocos-BCX have [switched ownership](https://alert.peckshield.com/detail?id=a58cd748-8a17-11ec-886a-00163e3673cd) to a multi-sig. 

_We should expect Dego Finance to do the same._
