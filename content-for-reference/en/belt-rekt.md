**Welcome to the slaughterhouse.**

An incorrect share valuation helps to add another notch to the now infamous flash loan exploit season on the BSC.

Yet another fork of a fork has rolled off the conveyor belt with $6.3M falling straight into the hands of the hacker.

Despite this being a slightly more sophisticated attack than some of the previous occurrences, all the familiar hallmarks are present.

**Another BSC protocol caught with its trousers down.**

Why do these projects continue to leave themselves vulnerable to such savage beatings? 

**With the bull market seeming to stall, is it time for hackers to take profit?**

1: Use 8 flash loans on $385M BUSD from PancakeSwap 

2: Deposit 10M BUSD in bEllipsisBUSD strategy (only for the first transaction, where it was the 'Most Undersubscribed Strategy')

3: Deposit 187M BUSD to bVenusBUSD strategy ('Most Undersubscribed Strategy') 

4: Swap 190M BUSD to 169M USDT through Ellipsis

5: Withdraw more BUSD from bVenusBUSD strategy ('Most Oversubscribed Strategy')

6: Swap 169M USDT to 189M BUSD through Ellipsis
 
7: Deposit BUSD to bVenusBUSD strategy ('Most Undersubscribed Strategy')

(Steps 4 - 7 were repeated 7 times) 

8: Repay flash loans and withdraw profit

The hacker was not the only one to profit, as the EPS LP and stakers also received their share of this [incident](https://twitter.com/Ellipsisfi/status/1398773543169523713).

The similarities between this exploit and the [Harvest Finance hack](https://rekt.eth.link/harvest-finance-rekt/) which we covered in October have not gone unnoticed. 

A startlingly familiar series of events led to the Harvest Hacker getting away with over $25m in stolen funds on that occasion and look who was [boasting about their new collaboration](https://twitter.com/harvest_finance/status/1398291953863692294?s=20) just two days before this latest incident.

Could the attack come from an external project on the seemingly [clueless](https://twitter.com/jeiwan7/status/1398805326250446849?s=20) developers at Belt?

With Binance loosely [weighing in](https://twitter.com/BinanceChain/status/1398838655481913346?s=20) on the situation, it seems there is no end in sight for the BSC bloodbath.

Which BSC protocol will be the next to buckle under pressure?
