**8ight Finance users are out of pocket.**

Although this is our first story taking place on the Harmony chain, there’s nothing new about the protocol.

_Another Olympus [fork](https://twitter.com/gsg0127/status/1467862357644910597?t=sbcC3R6ZqbW-1U1r4KuSHg&s=09), another set of [“compromised keys”](https://twitter.com/8ight_finance/status/1468073179784486912)._

**$1.75 million taken.**

_From the [8ight tweet](https://twitter.com/8ight_finance/status/1468073179784486912)._

**First transaction: 490,170 DAI**

**Second transaction: 378,417 DAI - 10,843 LP**

**Transfer from xxca1d account to cc541:  868,587 DAI**

_And then to Tornado._

**You would hope that we wouldn’t have to say this by now, however…**

_Don’t post your private keys on Facebook._

_Don’t post your private keys in a Google Doc._

**Poor OPSEC makes poor users.**

_”Security 101 - repeat after me…”_

**Despite their promises that a multi-sig was in place, _(it was not)_, this protocol fell to the most basic of errors.**

So basic in fact, that many are accusing the developer of pocketing the funds themselves.

**As always, some of the more financially, _or emotionally_, involved users, are planning their revenge. Have any of these groups of victims ever caught their attacker?** 

If this was a planned event, then it’s likely that the developers have a history of such behaviour. 

But surely they wouldn’t use the same brand name twice? 

_Would they?_

**$1.75 million gone, and perhaps the most interesting part of the story is that the developers were still using Facebook.**

_When will we stop referring to a blatant disregard for cyber security as “getting hacked"?_

**8ight Finance - maybe hacked, maybe rugged, definitely rekt.**
