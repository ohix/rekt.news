**Nothing to see here…**

_$7.94M stolen._

[LCX](https://www.lcx.com/) is the latest CEX to have suffered a private key exploit.

The attack began around 10:30 PM +UTC on January 8th. 

[Peckshield](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1479975560743129092) spotted it first, then an [official announcement](https://twitter.com/lcx/status/1479976459766833152) came shortly after. 

We’ve [said](https://rekt.news/bitmart-rekt/) it [before](https://rekt.news/ascendex-rekt/); if established companies holding millions of dollars of users’ funds can’t manage their own hot wallet security, what purpose do they serve?

**Why can’t they keep private keys private?** 

Is it really that difficult for a traditional corporate structure to maintain good practice?

_CeFi hacks leave us with little to say - we can only go on what the team chooses to tell us._

**Next time, they can write this article themselves.**
