excerpt: A white hat is not white if nobody can see it. The community rugged itself. Force DAO - the smallest airdrop followed by the most unremarkable hack.

**Nobody saw the white hat until it was too late.**

**The FORCE community rugged itself.**

At 08:50 UTC the following message was posted in the Force DAO Discord.

>We were alerted that a bug was found in the FORCE/xFORCE contract. The individual, for the safety of the token, removed all of them while getting in contact with us. We are all wide awake and working on this. With that, please do not attempt to trade FORCE tokens at this time while we address the situation.

Unfortunately, the message came too late - the community had already dumped their tokens, and the [white hat hacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf88a427c5bf29acf58497c0088cbf7ca9836b7b2#tokentxns) was left holding the bag. 

[FORCE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/force-dao) price fell 90% in a matter of minutes.

**Minted 347,432,986 xFORCE**

**Withdrew 4112 FORCE using minted xFORCE** [0x3b60252b36d2de2930a64f360926bfcba44d12ff44719de3c6dd486b9dafe118](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3b60252b36d2de2930a64f360926bfcba44d12ff44719de3c6dd486b9dafe118) 

**Sold FORCE via 1inch**

**Return 14,833 FORCE**

And finally, like vultures (with poor OPSEC), other hackers arrived to feed on the [leftovers.](https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1378633829771005957?s=20) 

**The money was returned, and Force narrowly avoided a spot on our [leaderboard](https://rekt.eth.link/leaderboard/),** but why would the white hat hacker take this responsibility when they could have placed it with the team?

Will this impact the price of [BADGER](https://twitter.com/al_digit_al/status/1378551264926126081?s=20)?

Is the team incompetent, or was the hacker hedging himself? Anyone could have minted and stolen it all, and as samczsun [wrote](https://t.me/lobsters_chat/222230);

>lmao the xforce vault didn't check the return value on transferFrom

**As a member of our OPSEC team mentioned;**

>They use the years old MiniMeToken contract which doesn't revert but returns false when you transferFrom without approval or not enough funds. So that's problematic per se. Should've wrapped it in a safeTransferFrom.

>But then they might've chosen to use a better token contract for FORCE anyway!

**Now even airdrops can cost you money.** 

What was considered one of the [smallest airdrops](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1378475110944886786?s=20) ever might actually end up a net negative for the users who claimed once they have deducted their gas costs.

**Force DAO - the smallest airdrop followed by the [easiest](https://twitter.com/0xdeadf4ce/status/1378635409886998534?s=20) hack.** 

_Please, if youâ€™re going to make us work on a Sunday then at least make it entertaining._
