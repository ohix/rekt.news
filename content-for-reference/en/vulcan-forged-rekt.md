**Four cases in ten days.**

~$415 million gone.

_“Compromised keys” are so hot right now._

[BitMart](https://rekt.news/bitmart-rekt/) ($196M), [8ight Finance](https://rekt.news/8ight-finance-rekt/) ($1.75M), [AscendEX](https://rekt.news/ascendex-rekt/) ($77.7M) and now Vulcan Forged ($140M).

_But it’s nothing to do with the markets, right?_

[Vulcan Forged](https://twitter.com/VulcanForged) is a “_blockchain game studio_” and “_NFT marketplace_” building fantasy play-to-earn games inside what they call the [VulcanVerse](https://twitter.com/vulcanverse).

The majority of the funds taken from users’ wallets was in the platform’s own token, [$PYR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vulcan-forged), which is used for in-game transactions and on their native marketplace.

In order to facilitate these use cases, user accounts are linked to an integrated wallet - a service provided by [Venly](https://www.venly.io/).

The private keys of 96 addresses were compromised, allowing the attacker to drain their contents. As well as $PYR, users also lost substantial amounts of other tokens including ETH and MATIC.

Hacker’s address on:

**[Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x48ad05a3B73c9E7fAC5918857687d6A11d2c73B1)**

**[Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x48ad05a3B73c9E7fAC5918857687d6A11d2c73B1)**

Funds have since been sent on to further wallets, for example [this one](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3cd90be37a79d9da86b5e14e2f6042cd0e53b66) containing ~$40M in $PYR and ~$600k in ETH. 

The team [claims](https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470209893114294282) to have identified an address that may be linked to a KYC’d exchange.

A total of over 4.5M PYR was extracted, with a value of ~$140M at the time of the attack.

Subsequent sales of the stolen PYR had a large impact on the token price, which dropped ~30% initially, from around $31 to a low of $21.47.

In contrast to the other cases, the Vulcan team has been quick to [respond](https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470201106626224140) to the incident, posting regular [updates](https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470315106986827777) on their Twitter feed and promising to both replace the stolen $PYR and remove the custodial wallets.

According to the [latest update](https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470365117774770180), the majority of affected wallets have already been  reimbursed from the treasury, and the team aims to pursue a 100% decentralised system going forward.

_The response from the team has been better than most, but that doesn’t mean we should be less suspicious._ 

“Compromised keys” can’t be analysed by outsiders; a fact which benefits only the insiders.

Who is to blame for this incident? Is it Vulcan Forged, for a lack of due diligence, or their wallet provider; Venly?

_Without further details; we will never know._
