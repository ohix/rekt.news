**The rekt.news anniversary auction is live.**

To celebrate our one year anniversary, and to fund our future development, we have created 20 unique NFTs.

17 of these rekt.news anniversary NFTs come from our debut video [“Hopium Diaries - Dystopian Dreams”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1Z5BnBuFyE&t=1s)

**The Hopium Diaries show our manifesto for a future of finance. We hope that this will become a key piece in the common vision that we all share. A vision that will keep spreading and evolving over time. We are now offering you the chance to own a part of this story.**

We have also created three unique NFTs for this anniversary, representing three of the most memorable stories of the past year; 

[**Poly Network**](https://www.rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) - The largest exploit ever. bigger than Mt Gox, bigger than all the other hacks put together. 

[**Pancake Bunny**](https://twitter.com/RektHQ/status/1397195892327858181?s=20) - When rekt.news became the news, and received a part of the loot.

[**Meerkat Finance**](https://www.rekt.news/meerkat-finance-bsc-rekt/) - The first major DeFi exploit outside of Ethereum.

_These NFTs represent a full year of work, they show the foundational moments of our brand._

As rekt.news grows, holders of these NFTs will come to realise their utility.

>The auction will last for 7 days, ending at 15:00 BST on 4.10.2021.

**If you believe in the future of DeFi, then you believe in the future of rekt.news.**

_$611 million dollars stolen. That’s more than the Mt Gox hack. More than the GDP of several small countries. More than the entire rekt.news leaderboard added together. The biggest cryptocurrency hack... ever._

_In retrospect, it was inevitable. We watched Binance Smart Chain as they did their speed run through Ethereum’s DeFi summer. Now their copied codes have built up enough capital, and they have entered the rug pull phase._

[**A New Generation**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/1)

_Children born into the uncertainty of the Coronavirus will reach adolescence in a strange new world, one of invasive and total monetisation._

[**Casino Reaper**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/3)

_Court cases will be opened in the hundreds or thousands as the prices of private company stocks are copied onto the blockchain allowing speculators to trade the volatility in a mirrored financial market that pays nothing to the middleman._

[**Currency Competition**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/14)

_Governments will be forced to incentivise their citizens to use their native currency over the decentralised alternative. Some will enforce this by law, while others will take a more liberal approach, but an alternative global economy will develop regardless._

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/daoactivity.png)

[**DAO Activity**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/5)

_We’ll look back on DeFi summer with nostalgia; a naïve but entertaining time, where we forged gamified concepts that later became utilitarian applications._

[**DeFi Summer - The Fall**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/6)

_The tension between the US, China and the EU will escalate, and decentralised currencies increase instability as countries lose control of their printing machines. China tokenises CNY and issues it on-chain, forcing the US to adapt, or get left behind._

[**Greedy Middleman**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/12)

_As the world realises the redundancy of the greedy middleman, empowerment will flow across all industries, as unprecedented forms of monetisation emerge._

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/highstreetbanks.png)

[**High Street Banks**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/4)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/slickarbitrageur.png)

[**Slick Arbitrageur**](https://opensea.io/assets/0xa32ba4034f9af9d558665c6a0c9ed9c1472f0752/8)

_Those who allow for total financial freedom still face dangers, as the unexpecting public become exposed to the experienced hackers and slick arbitrageurs of the decentralised underworld._
